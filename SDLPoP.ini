; SDLPoP configuration
; ====================

; This is the configuration file for SDLPoP.
; Lines starting with a semicolon (";") are comment lines and are ignored by SDLPoP.
; They are used to document the available customization options.

; "default" is a valid setting for any option.


[General]
; Enable or disable the potions (copy protection) level.
enable_copyprot = false

; Use mixer and enable music.
enable_mixer = true

; Enable or disable fading.
enable_fade = true

; Enable or disable flashing.
enable_flash = true

; Enable or disable texts.
enable_text = true

; Start the game in fullscreen mode. (In-game fullscreen toggle: Alt+Enter)
start_fullscreen = false

; Width and height of the game window.
; By default, the window is 640 pixels wide and 400 pixels tall.
; When using the "correct aspect ratio" option, the default height is 480 instead of 400.
pop_window_width = default
pop_window_height = default

; Render the game in the originally intended 4:3 aspect ratio.
; NB. Works best using a high resolution.
use_correct_aspect_ratio = false

; You can choose which levels to play using the 'levelset' option:
;    'original'       --> play the original levels (Default)
;    'Your Mod Name'  --> play a custom levelset (the custom files must be in a directory "mods/Your Mod Name/")

levelset = original

[AdditionalFeatures]
; Enable quicksave/load feature. (In-game: press F6 to quicksave, F9 to quickload)
enable_quicksave = true

; Try to let time keep running out when quickloading. (similar to Ctrl+A)
; Technically, the 'remaining time' is still restored, but with a penalty for elapsed time (up to 1 minute).
; The one minute penalty will also be applied when quickloading from e.g. the title screen.
enable_quicksave_penalty = true

; Enable recording/replay feature.
enable_replay = true
enable_scripts = true

[Enhancements]
use_fixes_and_enhancements = false

;    'prompt' --> the game will ask each time the game is launched
;    'true'   --> fixes and enhancements are used
;    'false'  --> fixes and enhancements are not used (Default)
;
; Below, you can pick which fixes/enhancements will be active.
; NB. If use_fixes_and_enhancements is set to 'false', all of the below options are disabled.


; Adds a way to crouch immediately after climbing up: press down and forward simultaneously.
; In the original game, this could not be done (pressing down always causes the kid to climb down).
enable_crouch_after_climbing = true

; Time runs out while the level ending music plays; however, the music can be skipped by disabling sound.
; This option stops time while the ending music is playing (so there is no need to disable sound).
enable_freeze_time_during_end_music = true

; Enable guard hitpoints not resetting to their default (maximum) value when re-entering the room.
enable_remember_guard_hp = true

; If a room is linked to itself on the left, the closing sounds of the gates in that room can't be heard.
fix_gate_sounds = true

; An open gate or chomper may enable the Kid to go through walls. (Trick 7, 37, 62)
fix_two_coll_bug = true

; If a room is linked to itself at the bottom, and the Kid's column has no floors, the game hangs.
fix_infinite_down_bug = true

; When a gate is under another gate, the top of the bottom gate is not visible.
; But this fix causes a drawing bug when a gate opens.
fix_gate_drawing_bug = false

; When climbing up to a floor with a big pillar top behind, turned right, Kid sees through floor.
; The current fix causes glitches you can see on bug_chomper.PNG and bug_climb.PNG .
fix_bigpillar_climb = false

; When climbing up two floors, turning around and jumping upward, the kid falls down.
; This fix makes the workaround of Trick 25 unnecessary.
fix_jump_distance_at_edge = true

; When climbing to a higher floor, the game unnecessarily checks how far away the edge below is;
; This contributes to sometimes "teleporting" considerable distances when climbing from firm ground.
fix_edge_distance_check_when_climbing = true

; Falling from a great height directly on top of guards does not hurt.
fix_painless_fall_on_guard = true

; Bumping against a wall may cause a loose floor below to drop, even though it has not been touched. (Trick 18, 34)
fix_wall_bump_triggers_tile_below = true

; When pressing a loose tile, you can temporarily stand on thin air by standing up from crouching.
fix_stand_on_thin_air = true

; Buttons directly to the right of gates can be pressed even though the gate is closed (Trick 1)
fix_press_through_closed_gates = true

; By jumping and bumping into a wall, you can sometimes grab a ledge two stories down (which should not be possible).
fix_grab_falling_speed = true

; When chomped, skeletons cause the chomper to become bloody even though skeletons do not have blood.
fix_skeleton_chomper_blood = true

; Controls do not get released properly when drinking a potion, sometimes causing unintended movements.
fix_move_after_drink = true

; A drawing bug occurs when a loose tile is placed to the left of a potion (or sword).
fix_loose_left_of_potion = true

; Guards may "follow" the kid to the room on the left or right, even though there is a closed gate in between.
fix_guard_following_through_closed_gates = true

; When landing on the edge of a spikes tile, it is considered safe. (Trick 65)
fix_safe_landing_on_spikes = true

; The kid may glide through walls after turning around while running (especially when weightless).
fix_glide_through_wall = true

; The kid can drop down through a closed gate, when there is a tapestry (doortop) above the gate.
fix_drop_through_tapestry = true

; When dropping down and landing right in front of a wall, the entire landing animation should normally play.
; However, when falling against a closed gate or a tapestry(+floor) tile, the animation aborts.
; (The game considers these tiles floor tiles; so it mistakenly assumes that no x-position adjustment is needed)
fix_land_against_gate_or_tapestry = true

; Sometimes, the kid may automatically strike immediately after drawing the sword.
; This especially happens when dropping down from a higher floor and then turning towards the opponent.
fix_unintended_sword_strike = true

; By repeatedly pressing 'back' in a swordfight, you can retreat out of a room without the room changing. (Trick 35)
fix_retreat_without_leaving_room = true

; The kid can jump through a tapestry with a running jump to the left, if there is a floor above it.
fix_running_jump_through_tapestry = true

; Guards can be pushed into walls, because the game does not correctly check for walls located behind a guard.
fix_push_guard_into_wall = true

; By doing a running jump into a wall, you can fall behind a closed gate two floors down. (e.g. skip in Level 7)
fix_jump_through_wall_above_gate = false
