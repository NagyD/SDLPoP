; ====================
; SDLPoP configuration
; ====================

; This is the configuration file for SDLPoP.
; Lines starting with a semicolon (";") are comment lines and are ignored by SDLPoP.
; They are used to document the available customization options.

; "default" is a valid setting for any option.

; N.B. You can also use the in-game menu to configure SDLPoP: press Escape or Backspace while in-game.
; The in-game configuration is saved to the file SDLPoP.cfg.
; The settings from the .cfg file will then be applied, until you modify SDLPoP.ini (this file) again.
