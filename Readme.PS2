# How to compile and run
Install latest PS2DEV toolchain, then go to src and run these commands:

```
cmake -S src -B build "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${PS2DEV}/share/ps2dev.cmake" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

Then move the `prince.elf` file into a dir with the data/ files (WITH MUSIC!),
then finally load it into your PS2.
