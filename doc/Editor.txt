SDLPoP built-in editor:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea to include an editor in SDLPoP being out there heaps of editors and tools is to allow live editing of the game. It also allows developers to change defined constants in the game (changing level size) to extend it and still having a working editor to create mods.

The concept is different to other editors. It is based on the game, so learning how to edit is different from other editors: users will have to learn more key codes in order to edit the levels.

The copied message:

When a single tile is copied the following text is displayed:
COPIED FG:tile_code/extra BG:mod

Where tile_code is the code of the tile (a number between 0 and 31). Extra is the high part of the tile (normally could be ignored).
mod is the modifier, it depends on the tile.

When a multiple tile block is copied the following text is displayed:
COPIED FG:tile_code/extra+tile_code/extraPos BG:mod+mod
same as above, but for the two tiles. Pos is where the extra tile is located: A for above, B for below, L for left and R for right.


TODO List/known bugs:
* Selection using the palette S8 redrawn: add image with smaller palette and modifiers below
* Automatic decoration of room.
* Drag rooms/groups of rooms on map
