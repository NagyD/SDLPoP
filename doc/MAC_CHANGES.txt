Makefile:			  A new OSX specific makefile.
seg007.c:  Line 608:  Clang was erroring because the comparison could never be equal, so I simplified it.
proto.h:   Line 500:
	and
seg009.c:  Line 85:	  Previous declaration of wait() in /usr/include/sys/wait.h, so I renamed the SDLPoP function
					  with a macro.

seg009.c:  Line 1915:
	and other places: "cast from pointer to smaller type 'int' loses information" error.  Changing the typecast
					  to (uintptr_t) gets rid of the warning/error, but does it slove the problem?  Is
					  there any danger? 

Everywhere else:	  Lots of added tyepcasts.  Some of the typecasts were strange, for example: (byte*)-1.
					  Is that dangerous?
