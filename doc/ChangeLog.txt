=============
(version 1.15)

General changes:
DONE: Migration from SDL1 to SDL2.
DONE: Game is now displayed at full resolution in fullscreen mode.
DONE: Window can now be resized.
DONE: Basic joystick support added.
DONE: Music files (*.ogg) are now bundled with the release.
CHANGE: Window is now displayed at 640 by 400 pixels by default.
CHANGE: Cleaned up harmless sound load errors.
CHANGE: Sound names are now read from file only once when sounds are loaded.
CHANGE: During loading of DAT files, read failures are now checked and reported.
CHANGE: More cleanly handle failures to read/write HOF file.
CHANGE: Improved reporting for known-failing loads.
CHANGE: Pass size of resource area instead of letting it get overridden.
CHANGE: The screen is now updated less frequently.
CHANGE: Tweaked timer behaviour. The game now attempts to correct for timer-related overhead somewhat, preventing screen updates lagging behind the monitor's refresh rate.
FIXED: Flashes are now displayed with a more consistent duration.
FIXED: Shift+L skipping cutscenes immediately is now prevented by a short delay timer.
FIXED: Fixed bug with flashes not repainting the screen upside down in flipped mode.
FIXED: Hardcoded font (hc_font) appeared as white rectangles.

New game additions and bug fixes:
DONE: Added quicksaving and quickloading (F6 to quicksave anywhere in a level, F9 to quickload).
- Also quicksave/quickload when shift is pressed
- Do not even attempt to quicksave after the kid has died
- Deny quicksave during the feather fall effect
- Allow quickloading from the title screen
FIXED: Prevented index to redraw_frames_above[] going out of bounds in set_redraw2(), triggered by loose tiles dropping out of the room from the rightmost column. This caused unpredictable behaviour, depending on the compiler.
FIXED: Fixed a bug where level doors would continue to open infinitely far when the global variable leveldoor_open has been modified due to special events or due to another level door being already open.
FIXED: Fixed the kid being able to enter closed level doors when there is another one open.
FIXED: Fixed a graphical bug occurring when the level start door is raised from the same room.
FIXED: Added optional fixes for a few gameplay quirks:
- Fix kid falling off the ledge when jumping after climbing two floors
- Fix "teleporting" four pixels further than necessary when climbing from firm ground while not in front of a wall
- Fix being able to survive lethal falls by jumping on top of a guard
- Fix triggering loose floors below by bumping into the wall above
- Enable the earlier fixes FIX_GATE_SOUNDS, FIX_TWO_COLL_BUG and FIX_INFINITE_DOWN_BUG.
- Fix temporarily standing on thin air when standing up on a falling loose tile
- Fix being able to press buttons through closed gates (Trick 1)
- Fix being able to grab ledges two stories down by bumping into a wall first
- Fix blood appearing on chompers when a skeleton is chomped
- Fix controls not being released during the drinking animation, causing unintended movement
- Add a way to crouch after climbing up (instead of climbing down again) by pressing down + forward
DONE: Increase the number of supported potion types to 32
- Quickloading is cancelled when a version string saved in QUICKSAVE.SAV does not match.
- Added rem_min and rem_tick to the quicksaved variables. The proposed penalty for quickloading is one minute subtracted from the saved remaining time.
FIXED: A drawing bug occurs when a loose tile is placed to the left of a potion (or sword).
- Fix guards following through closed gates
- Freeze time during the end level music
- Add option for debug cheats

Build changes:
DONE: Source code of the project has been added to GitHub.

FIXED: Resolved warnings about multi-string literals by using an enum instead.

Refactorings:
CHANGE: Lots of things have changed with the switch to SDL2. To read about game migration from SDL1 to SDL2 in general, the SDL wiki provides a good overview at https://wiki.libsdl.org/MigrationGuide

CHANGE: Added named enums for sound IDs, char_type.sword, timer IDs, colors, character frames and sequences.
CHANGE: Replaced a number of magic numbers in the code with their enum equivalents.
