CHANGE: More cleanly handle failures to read/write HOF file.
CHANGE: Improved reporting for known-failing loads.
CHANGE: Pass size of resource area instead of letting it get overridden.
CHANGE: The screen is now updated less frequently.
CHANGE: Tweaked timer behaviour. The game now attempts to correct for timer-related overhead somewhat, preventing screen updates lagging behind the monitor's refresh rate.
FIXED: Flashes are now displayed with a more consistent duration.
FIXED: Shift+L skipping cutscenes immediately is now prevented by a short delay timer.
FIXED: Fixed bug with flashes not repainting the screen upside down in flipped mode.

- Also quicksave/quickload when Shift is pressed
- Do not even attempt to quicksave after the kid has died
- Deny quicksave during the feather fall effect
- Allow quickloading from the title screen
FIXED: Prevented index to redraw_frames_above[] going out of bounds in set_redraw2(), triggered by loose tiles dropping out of the room from the rightmost column. This caused unpredictable behaviour, depending on the compiler.
FIXED: Fixed a bug where level doors would continue to open infinitely far when the global variable leveldoor_open has been modified due to special events or due to another level door being already open.
FIXED: Fixed the kid being able to enter closed level doors when there is another one open.
FIXED: Fixed a graphical bug occurring when the level start door is raised from the same room.
FIXED: Added optional fixes for a few gameplay quirks:
- Fix kid falling off the ledge when jumping after climbing two floors
- Fix "teleporting" four pixels further than necessary when climbing from firm ground while not in front of a wall
- Fix being able to survive lethal falls by jumping on top of a guard
- Fix triggering loose floors below by bumping into the wall above
- Enable the earlier fixes FIX_GATE_SOUNDS, FIX_TWO_COLL_BUG and FIX_INFINITE_DOWN_BUG.

- Fix controls not being released during the drinking animation, causing unintended movement
- Add a way to crouch after climbing up (instead of climbing down again) by pressing down + forward
DONE: Increase the number of supported potion types to 32
- Quickloading is cancelled when a version string saved in QUICKSAVE.SAV does not match.
- Added rem_min and rem_tick to the quicksaved variables. The proposed penalty for quickloading is one minute subtracted from the saved remaining time.
FIXED: A drawing bug occurs when a loose tile is placed to the left of a potion (or sword).
- Fix guards following through closed gates
- Freeze time during the end level music
- Add option for debug cheats

Build changes:

FIXED: Don't allow killing a skeleton in cheat mode.
FIXED: Ctrl+S didn't mute music (except death music).
FIXED: A falling tile on the left side of a pillar could cause the blue stripe to be drawn over the pillar.
FIXED: The top of moving gates became glitched on levels using non-default palettes.
FIXED: The right edge of pressed drop buttons was black if a big pillar was next to them.
FIXED: Guards appeared in the current room when they fell into spikes in an adjacent room. (Example: original level 11, room 22.)
FIXED: Show an error message if a data file is missing.
FIXED: "Remember guard hp" for non-standard guards.
FIXED: Colored torches were not restored on quickload if you (quit and) restarted the game after quicksave.
DONE: Added command-line parameter "mute": Start the game with sound off.
FIXED: Fixed compiling with some features #undefined. (USE_TEXT, USE_LIGHTING, USE_MENU)
DONE: Hide references to various features if the game was compiled without them.
DONE: A scrollbar appears in the pause menu if scrolling is possible.
	It's not clickable yet, it just shows where you are in the list.
DONE: Added command-line parameter "playdemo": Make the demo level playable.
FIXED: Fixed the detection of Ctrl+L during the demo level.
FIXED: Create the screenshots directory in SDLPoP's directory, even if the current directory is something else.
	This is to match how the replay folder works.
FIXED: On Windows, use Unicode/UTF-8 for mkdir().
	So the replay and screenshots directories can be created within non-ASCII paths.
FIXED: After quickload, show the room where the prince is, even if the player moved the view away from it (with the H,J,U,N keys).
FIXED: After quickload, don't draw guard HP if a previously viewed room (with the H,J,U,N keys) had a guard but the current room doesn't have one.
DONE: Speed up music, sounds, and transitions during fast forwarding.
FIXED: Prevent the modifier remapping from accessing out-of-range rooms.
FIXED: Don't show the mirror image if the prince is not in the currently shown room.
DONE: Added a new cheat key: Ctrl+B: Go back to the room where the prince is. (Undo H,J,U,N.)
FIXED: Fixed the length of feather fall in fast-forward mode.
FIXED: Prevent torches from being randomly colored when an older replay is loaded.
FIXED: If the prince is fighting a guard, and the player does a quickload to a state where the prince is near the mouse, the prince would draw the sword.
DONE: Added options for changing speeds. They are detected from PRINCE.EXE. (Used in Hurry up Prince, for example.)
DONE: In the settings menu, allow using Page Up, Page Down, Home, End.
FIXED: Fixed graphical glitches with an opening gate:
	1. with a loose floor above and a wall above-right.
	2. with the top half of a big pillar above-right.
	See FIX_ABOVE_GATE in config.h .
FIXED: Validate mode crashed with the error "init_scaling: SDL_CreateTexture: Invalid renderer".
DONE: Rewrote all mentions of key combinations to the "Ctrl+A" style.
DONE: Marked which features of SDLPoP are not in the original game. (To prevent confusions like #197)
DONE: Allow Backspace and Ctrl+C during replay.
DONE: During playback, display the number of ticks since start, if the timer is shown (debug cheats: T).
FIXED: Fixed crashing when a MIDI music interrupted another one.
FIXED: Make it possible to go through a certain closed gate on level 11 of Demo by Suave Prince.
	Details: https://forum.princed.org/viewtopic.php?p=32326#p32326
	Testcase: doc/replays-testcases/Demo by Suave Prince level 11.p1r
	See FIX_COLL_FLAGS in config.h .
FIXED: When the prince jumps up at the bottom of a big pillar split between two rooms, a part near the top of the screen disappears.
	Example: The top row in the first room of the original level 5.
	Details: See FIX_BIGPILLAR_JUMP_UP in config.h .
DONE: Added a debug cheat to quickload but keep the currently loaded level. (Shift+F9)
	Motivation: https://forum.princed.org/viewtopic.php?p=32556#p32556
FIXED: Fixed spiked/chomped/bumped guards teleporting into the wrong room. (if fixes are enabled)
	Details: https://github.com/NagyD/SDLPoP/pull/237
FIXED: Quicksave during feather fall mode. (if fixes are enabled)
	Details: https://github.com/NagyD/SDLPoP/pull/236
FIXED: Prevent the prince from entering a glitched room when he falls into a wall or he is revived near a wall.
	Details: doc/replays-testcases/Original level 2 falling into wall.txt
	Testcase: doc/replays-testcases/Original level 2 falling into wall.p1r
	See FIX_ENTERING_GLITCHED_ROOMS in config.h .
FIXED: Optimized OPL mixing (MIDI music).
	Details: https://github.com/NagyD/SDLPoP/pull/238
	"More importantly: when run on a Raspberry Pi Zero, the music went from unusable to perfect,"
FIXED: Fixed the prince sliding through closed gates when you are using the caped prince graphics.
	Details: See FIX_CAPED_PRINCE_SLIDING_THROUGH_GATE in config.h .
DONE: Added a compilation-time flag to disable all fixes for vanilla execution.
	Details: https://github.com/NagyD/SDLPoP/pull/239
FIXED: If the prince dies on level 14, don't return to the intro after the level was restarted.
	Details: See FIX_LEVEL_14_RESTARTING in config.h .
DONE: Waste an RNG cycle in loose_shake() to match DOS PoP.
DONE: In new replays, use deprecation_number = 2. On playback, waste the RNG cycle only if deprecation_number >= 2.
	Older replays have deprecation_number <= 1, and we don't waste the RNG cycle when playing them back.
DONE: When backing offscreen (to the left) from the first guard on level 7 (among others), simulate the glitch from DOS PoP, which causes the prince to fall through the floor.
	Details: See https://github.com/NagyD/SDLPoP/issues/229
FIXED: On Windows, use Unicode/UTF-8 for stat().
	So SDLPoP can load levels from mod folders when a replay file restarts the level or advances to the next level.
DONE: Added a more visible error message when a mod referenced by a replay file cannot be found in the mods folder.
DONE: Allow guard skill customizations in SDLPoP.ini.
DONE: Made FIX_DOORTOP_DISABLING_GUARD configurable.
